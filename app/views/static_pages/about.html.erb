    PINUS is a group of Indonesian Students in National University of Singapore
    (NUS) established in 1998. Starting as a humble group of Indonesians created
     to facilitate simple gatherings, PINUS has now grown into one of the most
     established Indonesian student groups in Singapore. Currently, we have more
      than five hundred members, and the number is still growing steadily every
      year.

  <p class="lead">
    As a group that facilitates Indonesians in NUS, we aspire to provide
    avenues for our members to express their unique opinion, talent and
    creativity. In PINUS, we believe in a learning and nurturing culture, and
    hence we also strive to serve as a place for our members to grow and gain
    various experience as an individual.

  <br/>
  <p class="lead">
    PINUS started as a non-formal group for Indonesian students in NUS under a Yahoo! mailing list which was founded on August 12, 1998. It was first utilised for the members to promote casual gatherings ("Together Day") over lunch, movies, friendly basketball matches - or even just to broadcast member achievements and the subsequent 'thanks' that follow: a channel of mass communication in those pre-Facebook days.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    It was formalised as an organisation and constitutionalized with vision and mission in 2006, with the pioneer executive committee formed for office term 2006/2007. Nevertheless, even before then, PINUS has already had some form of organisation within the group, with the existing position of a Head as well as committee members.
